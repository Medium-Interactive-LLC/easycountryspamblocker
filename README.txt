== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work anywhere? =

At the moment, Easy Country Spam Blocker only works for U.S.-based websites.

= Can I redirect to any website? =

Yes. Navigate to **Settings->Easy Country Spam Blocker** to change the redirection URL.

= Is this a security plugin? =

Not entirely. While blocking out visitors from regions/locations you do not want to target is very useful in preventing spam, it is not a real security measure.
